# Prediction-program
Predicts an answer in 'yes' or 'no'.

It is based on the game 'effeuiller la marguerite' in which the person plucks flower petals from the flower to find out whether it is 'yes' or 'no'. 

It is silly to pluck flower petals just to know whether it is 'yes' or 'no'.

So, avoid plucking flowers for this purpose. Instead use this program to know whether it is 'yes' or 'no'.
